-- RUTH:
-- Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
-- If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

-- EUGENE:
-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
-- Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- RAYMOND:
-- As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
-- In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
-- The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.



-- LEADS:
-- 1. between 10:15am - 10:25am thief left bakery parking lot. check security footage
    -- returns license plate

-- 2. before 10:15am thief withdrew money from ATM on Leggett St

-- 3. flight on July 29, 2021 first leaving Fiftyville
    -- they're going to LGA (destination airport code 4)
    -- 8:20am flight # 36

-- 4. Phone call: thief called someone just after 10:15am for less than one minute, asked them to buy ticket
